## Notes: Section 4: Peer Review

> If the submitter requests the article be peer reviewed a call will go out to reviewers

Are reviewers selected by submitters ? How? i.e. is there a searchable directory of peers ?

Should it not be open to anyone to review? 

I realise that this is a long term vision, but I would suggest that it should be completely open for review from anyone, and that initially "the call to reviewers" is not handled by Aletheia.

> Until the article has been peer reviewed and approved it wonâ€™t be downloadable through the client. Reviewers will see through the Aletheia client all the articles they can review and reviewing will be incentivised through reputation 

I don't understand this statement. How would anyone review it without downloading it first?

Again, I cannot think of a reason why an article should not be completely public, immediately after submission. 

> a portion of any available funds will be routed to the user as payment on successful completion of the task once the community verifies by a vote that the review was legitimate

Nitpicking... but this implies that a submitted article is given a peer review "bounty" (in ether?) on submission. It's just not explicitly stated anywhere.

## Section 5: Acceptance onto the Blockchain

> A quorum will be calculated from the number of recent logins to Aletheia

Would an Ethereum Dapp have the concept of a "login"? this would imply a "session". Maybe my misunderstanding, but I would have thought that all interactions with the blockchain are done statelessly, via your wallet, and ethereum contracts.

## Section 6: The rights to content shared via Aletheia and takedown orders

> Content that has not been published elsewhere that is submitted to Aletheia...

This wording may be a bit confusing. I think it implies that Aletheia is an organisation that stores data. Surely this is not the case. Is Aletheia simply a vehicle for storing data in a decentralised database? Thus only controllable by those who submit the article ?

> Aletheia takes no responsibility for the actions of users, but will comply with takedown orders ...
and
> In the event Aletheia receives a takedown order a notification will be sent to the community through the Aletheia client

This implies that the Aletheia foundation is 'special' or has a special level of control over the whole system. This makes the Aletheia foundation a central point of failure for the entire system - which is what we are trying to avoid. I think it should be clear that the Aletheia software is simply a mechanism for submitting data to a public database.

By providing a mechanism to send notifications to client, we are in fact taking responsibility for our users actions.

In any case, as we are just an open source codebase, there is nothing stopping someone modifying the code and contracts to ignore the takedown orders.

In my opinion, the mechanism for complying with takedown orders should be firmly on the hands of the submitter.
